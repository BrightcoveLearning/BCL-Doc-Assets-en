<p>If you have Windows, you can download and install cURL as follows.</p>

<h3>Installing cURL</h3>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>In Windows, create a new folder called <strong>curl</strong> in your C: drive.</p>

	<p><code>C:curl</code></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Go to <a href="//cygwin.com/install.html">https://cygwin.com/install.html</a> follow the instructions there, choosing the 32-bit or 64-bit installer according to the system you have. During the install you will be prompted for packages to install. Open the Net package, then check the <strong>curl</strong> option and then finish the installation.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Test your setup</h2>

<p>To run <code>cURL</code> commands, you just type curl (with appropriate flags for the request you want to make) at the Terminal or DOS prompt, and then pressing Return. To make sure cURL is correctly installed, open a Terminal or DOS window, type <code>curl</code> at the prompt, and press Return. You should see a message like this:</p>

<span class="notranslate"><pre class="line-numbers">
  <code class="language-bash">curl: try 'curl --help' or 'curl --manual' for more information</code></pre></span>

<h2 id="sendData">Sending Data</h2>

<p>If you need to send data with the API request (as in a POST or PATCH request, for example), there are several ways to do it. You can include the data inline or in a separate file. Here is a Player Management API example submitting the data as a separate JSON file:</p>

<span class="notranslate"><pre class="line-numbers">
  <code class="language-bash">curl --request POST
    --url https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/57838016001/players
    --header 'authorization: Bearer <span class="bcls-input">YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE</span>'
    --header 'content-type: application/json'
    <span class="bcls-highlight">--data <strong>&lt;</strong>player_data/player_config.json</span> </code></pre></span>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--info">Note the "&lt;" symbol, which sends the file contents. Use this rather than the "@" symbol, which attaches the file as an upload.</aside>
