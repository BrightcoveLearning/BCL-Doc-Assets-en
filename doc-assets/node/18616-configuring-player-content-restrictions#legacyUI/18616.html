<p>The player <strong>Content Restriction</strong> properties can be used to restrict a player to particular countries, or block a player from particular countries. Domain restrictions can be added to a player to limit the domains where the player can be used.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: The <strong>Content Restriction</strong> properties are only available to Enterprise and Professional accounts.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: IP address can also be used to limit playback For information, see <a href="/node/8065">Restricting Video Playback Using IP Address</a>.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: For the legacy Players module UI go <a href="#legacyUI">here</a>.</p>

<p>To view and edit the <strong>Content Restriction</strong> properties for a player, open the Players module, click on a player name and click <strong>Content Restriction </strong>in the left navigation menu.</p>

<h2 id="domains">Configuring domain restrictions</h2>

<p>Domain restrictions can be set on players to limit the domains where players can be used. If the player publishing code is copied and used on another site, domain restrictions would prevent the player from loading any videos. Publishers must use the in-page embed code to actually get playback working on those domains that have been whitelisted. Publishers cannot use the iframe embed code on a whitelisted domain (or any other domain) and expect playback to function properly.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: While domain restrictions can help prevent unauthorized distribution of your content, customers seeking maximum content security should look at DRM solutions instead. See <a href="/node/18436">Digital Rights Management (DRM) in Video Cloud</a> for more information.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: For viewers using Internet Explorer, the domain restriction feature requires version 10 or newer. Viewers using Internet Explorer &lt; 10 will not get playback at all.</p>

<p>To configure a domain restriction for a player, follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="bcls-tasklist">
	<li>Enter one or more complete URLs (such as http://www.brightcove.com or https://www.brightcove.com) to restrict your player's availability to these particular domains. Be sure to include either http:// or https://.
	<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node15616-domains1.png" /></div>

	<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Complete URLs must be provided. Wildcards in URLs are not supported. URLs should not end with a /.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ol>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: If using domain restrictions, you configure domain restrictions for all players in your account. If you don't, you're vulnerable to someone taking the policy key from an unprotected player and using it to play any video.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: While there is no limit on the number of domains that can be added in Studio, there is a limit on the length of the URL for the API request - included in that URL will be the comma-delimited list of domains. Therefore there is a limit on the number of domains that can be specified, but the number will depend on how long the domain names are.</p>

<p>Geo filtering can be used to control which countries can, and cannot, use a player.</p>

<div class="BCL-aside">Notes:

	<li>Some publishers have requested the ability to geo filter players to US military bases as well as the US. To support this, there is a <strong>US Military</strong> option. While there is no 100% reliable way to identify a military base, when an IP that resolves to a .mil domain is encountered, and is not in the US, it will be identified as coming from a US military base rather than its actual country of origin. .mil addresses that are in the US will still be identified as "us".</li>

<p>Domain restrictions are implemented by the account's policy key. If an account has any non-domain restricted policy keys generated for it, those keys can be used to watch any content in the account. Therefore, all policy keys for an account must be domain restricted.</p>
