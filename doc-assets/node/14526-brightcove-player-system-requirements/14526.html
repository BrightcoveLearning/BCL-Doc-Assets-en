All other IE versions and configurations use the Silverlight plugin.</li>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Only real machines are supported. While we expect that the player will generally work on virtual machines, we do not test on VM configurations and do not support them.</li>
	<li>Wherever Flash Player is needed, the latest version is required.</li>
	<li>The “Stock” browser found on earlier versions of Android (often with an icon named “Internet”) has a number of unworkable issues with video playback and is not recommended.</li>
</ul>
