<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In updating media sharing to work with the CMS API, we have also updated the feature generally to make it work better for you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shared videos will now use assets (renditions and text tracks) from the Master account, so that changes to the assets (such as replacing or retranscoding the video) are automatically inherited by the shared videos.</li>
	<li>You can now directly manage sharing relationships without the help of Brightcove Support.</li>
	<li>Media sharing will work with Dynamic Delivery videos, even if Dynamic Delivery is not enabled for the account(s) you share to.</li>
</ul>

<p>For details on using the new media sharing in Studio, see <a href="/node/15924">Sharing Videos to Other Accounts</a>.</p>

<p>For details on using the new media sharing via the CMS API, see <a href="/node/18325">Media Sharing with the CMS API</a>.</p>

<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">If at any time you have both the old and new media sharing systems enabled for your account while you are testing new integrations, <strong>do not share the same video using both the old and new systems!</strong></aside>

<p>The following table explains terminology related to media sharing.</p>

<table class="bcls-table">
	<caption class="bcls-caption--table">Media Sharing Terminology</caption>
	<thead class="bcls-table__head">
		<tr>
			<th>Account</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody class="bcls-table__body">
		<tr>
			<td>Master</td>
			<td>The account that created the original video.
			<p>The Master owns the content and is responsible for setting up, managing and providing content to Affiliates.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Affiliate</td>
			<td>The account that is receiving the video.
			<p>The Affiliate can accept content shared to it from a Master.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Channel</td>
			<td>A pipeline through which content is shared from a Master to any number of Affiliates. When media sharing is enabled a <code>default</code> channel will be created in your account.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Relationship</td>
			<td>Describes the interaction between a Master and an Affiliate.
			<p>A relationship is comprised of a Master to share content, a Channel through which content is shared, a Contract for accepting content, and an Affiliate to receive content.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Contract</td>
			<td>Describes sharing relationship between a Master and an Affiliate.
			<p>A contract is created by the Master, and then must be accepted for sharing to be enabled. The Affiliate can also specify whether shared videos are accepted automatically or must be approved one by one.</p>

<h2 id="Whats_different">What's different?</h2>

<p>The most significant changes in shared media behavior are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In the new Media Sharing <strong>Affiliate accounts can no longer add captions to videos</strong> they’ve received through a share. <strong>Shared videos will always use the captions that are set in the Master account.</strong></li>
	<li>In the new Media Sharing Affiliate accounts can no longer add their own renditions to videos they've received through a share.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, Affiliate accounts will inherit any captions and renditions for the original video in the Master account. They will also automatically inherit any changes to those assets (through replacing or retranscoding the video, or replacing the captions).</p>

<p>Affiliate accounts will still be able to modify other video metadata, such as the name, description, and tags.</p>

<p>Images (the thumbnail and poster) are a special case: as long as the Affiliate does not replace the images, any changes made in the Master account will be inherited. Once the Affiliate replaces the images, changes in the Master account will no longer be inherited (unless the video is reshared, in which case all Affiliate changes will be overwritten).</p>

<p>For more details on how the new sharing works, see <a href="/node/18325">Media Sharing with the CMS API</a>.</p>

<h2 id="How_to_migrate">How to migrate</h2>

<p>To migrate your account to the new media sharing, submit a request to Support.</p>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="What_happens">What happens when you migrate?</h2>

<p>Here is what will happen when you migrate to the new media sharing:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When an account is moved forward all existing sharing relationships between Master and Affiliates will be preserved.</li>
	<li>When an account is moved forward all shared videos will remain shared as they had been.</li>
	<li>When a Master with Affiliates who do not share themselves is moved forward, the Affiliates will also be moved forward automatically. Affiliates who also have media sharing enabled will need to make their own requests to Support to migrate forward.</li>
	<li>When an account is moved forward it will no longer be able to share through the Media APIs.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="What_about_integrations">What about integrations?</h2>

<p>If you are using your own CMS or other app for media sharing operations through the Media API, you will need to update the integration to use the <a href="/node/18372">CMS API</a> instead. See <a href="/node/18325">Media Sharing with the CMS API</a> for details of the CMS API requests involved in media sharing.</p>

<section class="bcls-section">
<h2 id="Limitations">Limitations</h2>
