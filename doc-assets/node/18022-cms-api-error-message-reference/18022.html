<h2 id="Media_sharing_errors">Media Sharing Errors</h2>

<p>Media sharing errors are not returned as a separate error response to the API request, but rather in an <code>error_message</code> field in the normal reponse:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">[
    {
      "video_id" : "394872349182374",
      "affiliate_id" : "234987239487",
      "affiliate_video_id" : "30308254055202",
      "status" : "COMPLETE",
      "shared_at" : "2017-12-11T17:57:45.530Z",
      "updated_at" : "2017-12-11T18:03:32.789Z",
      "error_message" : <span class="bcls-highlight">"[{"error_code":"MISSING_CUSTOM_FIELDS","error_message":"Affiliate account is missing custom fields: [whisky]"}]"</span>
    }
]</code></pre>

<p>The <code>error_message</code> json will be an array of error objects, object will have <code>error_code</code> and <code>error_message</code>.</p>

<h3><code>error_code</code></h3>

<p>The error code will usually be sharing-specific but it could be any of the valid error codes that can be returned by a PATCH (update) operation on a video as well. The sharing specific error codes are shown in the table below.</p>

			<td><code>NOT_FOUND</code></td>
			<td><code>Resource does not exist.</code></td>
			<td>Something was missing. Usually this means the master video is gone. This can happen if a share request is immediately followed by a delete of the master video. This might also mean the master account does not have a channel yet or if the affiliate account does not exist or is not a valid member of the channel. This might happen if something went wrong in migration to CMS API media sharing.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>UNKNOWN</code></td>
			<td><code>Sharing failed with an unknown error, error_id INSERT-UNIQUE-ERROR-ID</code></td>
			<td>Something unexpected happened. The error_message will include an error id that can be used by devops to identify the underlying cause. Retrying the share attempt will work in many cases.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>VALIDATION_ERROR</code></td>
			<td><code>{field}: ILLEGAL_VALUE</code></td>
			<td>If {field} is "economics" then the problem is that the master video is "AD SUPPORTED" but the affiliate account does not have ads enabled. If {field} is something else, then investigation is required.</td>

			<td><code>Reference id whatever-you-used is already in use.</code></td>
