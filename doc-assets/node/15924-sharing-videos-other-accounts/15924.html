<p>Media sharing allows publishers to upload videos once and then share the videos to other accounts. The accounts can be your own, corporate accounts or accounts of other publishers. The shared videos can then be used independently in the other Video Cloud accounts. Media sharing is typically used when publishers want to keep a master account of video content and then share videos out to other divisions or subsidiaries of the organization.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Media sharing is available only for Video Cloud Pro and Enterprise customers with multiple accounts. If you are interested in upgrading your Video Cloud account, please contact Brightcove for more information.</p>

<div span="" class="BCL-aside">
<p>Note: If your account is using the updated media sharing interface, see <a href="/node/18465">Media Sharing using the Media Module</a>. Your account is using the updated media sharing if the top of the <strong>Admin &gt; Media Sharing</strong> page looks like this:</p>

<div><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="https://img.brightcove.com/node15924-new-ui.png" /></div>
</div>

<p>Media sharing is also supported by the Media API. For more information, see <a href="/node/1365">Media Sharing with the Media API</a>.</p>

<p>This topic will use the following terminology:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sharer - Account that shared the video</li>
	<li>Sharee - Account that the video was shared to</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enable">Enabling media sharing</h2>

<p>To enable media sharing, contact <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/contact/create">Brightcove Customer Support</a> and have them turn on media sharing for your account. Brightcove Customer Support will also need to turn on media sharing for each sharee account with which you want to share. You'll need to provide Brightcove Support with the Video Cloud account ID for each sharee account with which you want to share.</p>

<h3 id="sharebyref">Media sharing renditions by reference</h3>

<p>When you request that your account be enabled for media sharing, you can request that the account you want to share videos from be enabled for <em>media sharing renditions by reference</em>. Media sharing renditions by reference handles shared videos differently from the "traditional" media sharing feature. When media sharing renditions by reference is enabled on the account you want to share videos from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Videos can be shared to other accounts <strong>before</strong> transcoding has completed. Affiliate accounts that receive the shared video will have access to the renditions that were created in the source account.</li>
	<li>If the video in the source account is retranscoded, or if the source file is changed, those changes will occur in the affiliate accounts that receive the shared video.</li>
	<li>Posters and thumbnails for the source videos will be used in the affiliate accounts. If changes are made to the poster and/or thumbnail in the source account, those changes will be reflected in the affiliate accounts <strong>unless</strong> the affiliate account has previously generated a new poster or thumbnail image. Once the affiliate account makes a change to the poster or thumbnail, any changes to the poster/thumbnail made in the source account <strong>will not </strong>propagate to the affiliate accounts.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want media sharing by reference, make sure to let <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/en/contact/create">Brightcove Customer Support</a> know when your support request is made.</p>

<h2 id="disable">Disabling media sharing</h2>

<p>To terminate a media sharing relationship with an sharee account, you need to contact <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/en/contact/create">Brightcove Customer Support</a>. Terminating a media sharing relationship <strong>does not</strong> remove any shared videos from the sharee's account. If you want to remove shared videos from a sharee's account, you need either to get the sharee to agree to delete them or delete them from your own account before you terminate the media sharing relationship.</p>

<h2 id="auto">Automatically accepting shared videos</h2>

<p>By default, when videos are shared to your account, the videos don't become part of your media library until they are accepted. However, it is possible to automatically accept videos shared to you. To automatically accept shared videos, you need to configure the account to mark the affiliate as one from which you will automatically accept shared videos.</p>

<h2 id="custom">Sharing videos with custom fields</h2>

<p>If the sharer and sharee accounts use custom fields, you need to decide what happens if the two accounts use different custom fields. Accounts can be configured with the following behaviors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the two accounts have different custom fields, the fields that match identically will be shared and the non-matching custom fields will be ignored</li>
	<li>If the destination account does not have the same custom fields that are defined in the source account, the sharing operation fails with the message <strong>Custom Metadata conflict</strong>. The destination account is permitted to have additional custom field definitions that are not in the sharing account.</li>

<h2 id="reqfields">Sharing videos with required fields</h2>

<p>If the account the video is shared into (sharee account) is configured with required fields, you need to decide what happens when videos are shared and required fields are missing. The process is different based upon if shared videos are configured to be <a href="#manual">manually approved</a> or <a href="#auto">automatically approved</a>.</p>

<div class="BCL-subsection">
<h3 id="manual">Manual approval</h3>

<p>If you use manual approval for shared videos (the default):</p>

	<li>If all the required fields are populated in a shared video, you can accept the video by clicking <strong>Accept</strong>.</li>
	<li>If a shared video is missing one or more required fields, when you click <strong>Accept</strong>, the video will be added to the account as inactive.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="BCL-subsection">
<h3 id="auto">Automatic approval</h3>

<p>If you use automatic acceptance for shared videos:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If all the required fields are populated in a shared video and the video is active in the sharer's account, it will be active in the sharee account as soon as it is shared.</li>
	<li>If a shared video is missing one or more required metadata fields, it will appear in the <strong>Shares Pending</strong> view in the Media module. In order to accept the video into your account, you must manually accept it. Click <strong>Accept</strong> to add the video to the account as inactive.

<h2 id="work">Working with shared videos</h2>

<p>When you share a video with an affiliate publisher, a copy of the video is created in the affiliate's Video Cloud Media Library. Once you have shared a video, your affiliate can see the video in their account in the Media module.</p>

<p class="BCL-aside">Note: Media sharing can be configured so that renditions are shared by reference. You should review the <a href="#sharebyref">Media sharing renditions by reference</a> section of this document to see if this media sharing option is better suited to your needs vs. traditional media sharing.</p>

<p>The following video properties are copied to the shared video:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Name&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Short Description&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Long Description&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Reference ID (If any of the affiliate accounts that you are sharing with already have a video with the same reference ID, the sharing operation fails with an error message. You can avoid this by setting up reference ID naming conventions that prevent affiliates from using the same reference IDs.)</li>
	<li>Related Link (link text and link URL)&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Tags&nbsp;(Note: Tags from shared videos will not appear in the tag type ahead dropdown in the Media module)</li>
	<li>Thumbnail</li>
	<li>Video Still</li>
	<li>Text Tracks</li>
	<li>Economics (No Advertising / Advertising)</li>
	<li>Force Ad Request On/Off</li>
	<li>Ad key/value pairs</li>
	<li>Allow viral distribution On/Off</li>
	<li>Scheduling start date and end date</li>
	<li>Geo-restriction (Geo-restricted videos can only be shared with sharee accounts that are also geo-restricted.&nbsp; Sharing a geo-restricted video to an account that does not have geo-filtering enabled will cause the entire share action to fail, even if some of the sharees do have geo-filtering enabled.)</li>
	<li>Custom fields. See the <a href="#custom">Sharing videos with custom fields</a> section of this document for information about how to handle the case where the two accounts may not have the same custom field definitions.</li>
	<li>Cue points with their associated metadata</li>
</ul>

<p>The copy has all the values for these video metadata fields that the original had in your account at the moment you share it. However, from that point on, the original copy in your account and the shared copy in your affiliate's account become independent entities:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Video files are not copied when you use Media Sharing, only the video metadata is copied. The shared video points to the original video files in your account.</li>
	<li>Any changes you make to the original video in your account will not affect the shared copy in your affiliates' accounts (unless the video was <a href="#sharebyref">shared by reference</a>).</li>
	<li>If the video is deleted from the sharer account, the video is deleted from all sharee accounts.</li>
	<li>Any changes a sharee makes will not affect the original or any other shared copies. If the sharee deletes a shared video, it is removed from the sharee's account but remains in the original account and in all other sharee accounts.</li>
	<li>To update text track captions via the CMS API, you should use an <a href="https://brightcovelearning.github.io/Brightcove-API-References/cms-api/v1/doc/index.html#api-videoGroup-Update_Video">Update (PATCH)</a> request. You can't remove or update captions via Media Module in Studio of the affiliate's account.</li>
	<li>When your account receives a video by sharing, it is in the active state. This is true even if the video was not active in the account that shared the video to you. If you are using the <a href="/node/15531">metadata assurance feature</a>, and the video is missing required fields, you will be prompted to enter a value for the required fields when you accept the video. If you accept the video without entering values for the required fields, the video will not be activated.</li>
	<li>An account that receives a video by sharing cannot share that video to another account. Only the original account can share the video.</li>
	<li>Each account is billed separately for playback (video plays and bandwidth usage) of a shared video from that account.</li>
	<li>Reporting about a shared video is specific to each account and does not aggregate information about each copy of the video in each account.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="BCL-concept">
<h2 id="billing">Shared media &amp; billing</h2>

<p>We often get questions on how media that is shared between publishers affects billing. Below are a few scenarios that explain how billing is handled for content that is shared between publishers.</p>

<p>Scenario 1</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pub A and Pub B with content on Brightcove CDN</li>
	<li>Pub A shares to Pub B</li>
	<li>Pub B pays Brightcove for streams and bandwidth</li>
</ul>

<p>Scenario 2</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pub A using BYO CDN</li>
	<li>Pub B on Brightcove CDN OR BYO CDN (doesn't matter)</li>
	<li>Pub A shares to Pub B</li>
	<li>Pub B pays Brightcove for streams; Pub A pays their own CDN for bandwidth</li>
</ul>

<p>Scenario 3</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pub A with content on Brightcove CDN</li>
	<li>Pub B using BYO CDN</li>
	<li>Pub A shares to Pub B</li>
	<li>Pub B pays Brightcove for streams and bandwidth assuming that the billing parameters are being passed.</li>
</ul>
